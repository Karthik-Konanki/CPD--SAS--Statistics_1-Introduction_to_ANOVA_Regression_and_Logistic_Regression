# CPD--SAS--Statistics_1-Introduction_to_ANOVA_Regression_and_Logistic_Regression
Notes and labs from SAS Statistics 1 - Introduction to ANOVA, Regression and Logistic Regression

This introductory course is for SAS software users who perform statistical analyses using SAS/STAT software. The focus is on t tests, ANOVA, and linear regression, and includes a brief introduction to logistic regression. This course (or equivalent knowledge) is a prerequisite to many of the courses in the statistical analysis curriculum.
A more advanced treatment of ANOVA and regression occurs in the Statistics 2: ANOVA and Regression course. A more advanced treatment of logistic regression occurs in the Categorical Data Analysis Using Logistic Regression course and the Predictive Modeling Using Logistic Regression course.

This course can help prepare you for the following certification exam(s): SAS Certified Clinical Trials Programmer Using SAS 9, SAS Statistical Business Analysis Using SAS 9: Regression and Modeling, SAS Big Data Preparation, Statistics, and Visual Exploration.

### Learn how to:
- generate descriptive statistics and explore data with graphs
- perform analysis of variance and apply multiple comparison techniques
- perform linear regression and assess the assumptions
- use regression model selection techniques to aid in the choice of predictor variables in multiple regression
- use diagnostic statistics to assess statistical assumptions and identify potential outliers in multiple regression
- use chi-square statistics to detect associations among categorical variables
- fit a multiple logistic regression model
- score new data using developed models
